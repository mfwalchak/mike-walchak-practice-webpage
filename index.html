  <h2>Writing From Scratch</h2>
    <p>This webpage is being written in a fairly old-school way, entirely in a text document in Notepad!</p>
    <p>No IDE, no color-coding or help with spacing</p>
    <p>I figure the best way to get <strong>great at coding</strong> is the same way I got <strong>great at cooking</strong>: making things from scratch!</p>
  <h2>Did I Mention I'm a Chef?</h2>
    <p>I've worked as a professional chef for over 15 years. From your local dive bar to some of the classiest restaurants
    and private country clubs in Denver, I've spend the better part of two decades honing my craft in the kitchen.</p>
    <p>But....</p><br>
    <p>I always wanted to learn how to code.</p>
